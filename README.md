# Indian_Railway_Analysis
This project Visualises the Indian Railways network from open data, mapping 8,100+ stations and 11,000+ trains. Nodes are stations, edges are routes, with colors for hubs, majors, clusters, and train types. The result is a stunning, galaxy-like map revealing real-world geographic and connectivity patterns.
